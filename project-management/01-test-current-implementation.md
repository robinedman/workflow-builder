# 01 - Test Current Workflow Builder Implementation ✅

## Status: COMPLETE

## Goal
Verify that the refactored plugin architecture works correctly with the existing nodes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Build extension (`pnpm run build`)
- [x] Load in Chrome and test workflow builder opens
- [x] Create workflow: Get Page Text → Summarize → Output
- [x] Verify nodes execute in correct order (following edges)
- [x] Verify output node shows summarized text
- [x] Save workflow and verify it persists
- [x] Create workflow: Get Page Text → Translate → Output
- [x] Verify translation works with configured languages
- [x] **Implemented Prompt Node** - Custom Gemini Nano prompts with editable instructions

## Technical Notes
- Uses new plugin architecture with separated executors
- Workflow engine now uses topological sort to follow edges
- Node outputs properly pass between connected nodes

## Completed Work
- ✅ All existing nodes verified working
- ✅ Implemented Prompt Node with:
  - Custom prompt textarea
  - Combines input with user instruction: `Input text: {input}\n\nInstruction: {prompt}`
  - Model status indicators (checking/downloading/ready)
  - Editable after completion with "✓ Edit & re-run anytime" hint
  - Disabled only while running
- ✅ Added Prompt API trial token to manifest
- ✅ Workflow engine correctly follows edge connections
- ✅ Save/load workflows working
