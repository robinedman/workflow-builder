# 05 - Popup Workflow List & Execution ✅

## Status: COMPLETE

## Goal
Show saved workflows in extension popup with ability to run them on the current page.

## Story
As a user, I want to see my saved workflows in the popup and run them with one click so that I can quickly execute workflows without opening the builder.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Update popup UI to show list of saved workflows
- [x] Each workflow shows: name, node count, "Run" button
- [x] "Run" button triggers workflow on current tab
- [x] Show loading state while workflow runs (spinner + "Running...")
- [x] Display success/error feedback after execution (auto-dismisses)
- [x] Keep "Open Workflow Builder" button at top (now "New" button)
- [x] Empty state shows "No workflows saved yet" with link to builder

## Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Load workflows from storage
const workflows = await getAllWorkflows();

// On click:
await executeWorkflow(workflow, {
  tabId: currentTabId,
  mode: 'headless',
  // pageContext can be added later when needed
});
```

Results appear on page via output nodes (no popup display needed).

## Completed Work
- ✅ Complete popup redesign
  - Clean header with "Workflows" title
  - "New" button (pink) to open workflow builder
  - Workflow list with cards showing name and node count
  - Blue "Run" button with Play icon
  - Loading state: Spinner + "Running..." text
  - Success state: Green checkmark + "Workflow completed!" (auto-dismisses after 2s)
  - Error state: Red X + error message (auto-dismisses after 4s)
  - Empty state: Helpful message + link to create first workflow
  - Footer note: "Results will appear on the page"
- ✅ Proper state management for multiple workflows
- ✅ Button disables while running
- ✅ Uses browser API (WXT compatible)
