# 04 - Page-Integrated Output Nodes ✅

## Status: COMPLETE

## Goal
Add output nodes that display results directly on the page.

## Story
As a user, I want workflow results to appear on the page I'm viewing (popovers, banners, etc.) so that I can see results in context without switching tabs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **Selection Popover Node** - Shows result near selected text
  - Positions near selection using selectionRect
  - Auto-closes if de-selecting
  - Has manual close button (×)
  - Closes on click outside
  - White background with shadow and border
  - Max-width 400px, responsive positioning
  
## Technical Implementation
Outputs inject code via `chrome.scripting.executeScript`:
```typescript
await chrome.scripting.executeScript({
  target: { tabId },
  func: (text, rect) => {
    // Vanilla JS to create popover
  },
  args: [input, selectionRect]
});
```

## Completed Work
- ✅ Selection Popover Node implemented
  - Gets current selection position dynamically
  - Injects styled popover with vanilla JS
  - Positions near selection (or center if no selection)
  - Close button (×) in top-right
  - Auto-closes on:
    - Selection change (user deselects)
    - Click outside popover
  - Clean white design with shadow
  - Removes previous popovers automatically
  - No React bloat - pure vanilla JS injection

## Example Workflow
```
Get Selected Text → Summarize → Selection Popover
```
User selects text → clicks Run → summary appears in popover next to selection!
